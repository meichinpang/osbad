Hyperparameter Tuning
=========================

In this study, we implemented hyperparameter tuning for unsupervised 
anomaly detection models using two different methods: 

  (1) Leveraging meta-learning with labelled outliers to train a model with 
      hyperparameter tuning (training dataset) and subsequenty predict the 
      model performance on new, unlabeled datasets (test dataset) and 
  (2) Using the output from the unsupervised model (e.g., predicted inliers 
      from all anomaly detection models) as features for a supervised task, 
      and adjust the unsupervised model's hyperparameters to maximize 
      the performance of the downstream supervised model. 
      
Instead of blindly trying random hyperparameters as in random search or 
computing expensive hyperparameter searching as in grid search, 
we implemented Bayesian optimization to build a probabilistic model of the 
objective function and to choose the most promising hyperparameters.
